## üìñ About the project

Bite is a full-stack web application developed for a modern restaurant experience. The application makes it easy for both new and returning guests to interact with the restaurant digitally ‚Äì directly via the website. The focus has been on user experience (UX), responsive design and interactive functionality.

- Book a table directly via a convenient pop-up form placed on top of the page for increased accessibility.

- Create an account or log in to access personalized functionality.

- View your own reservations, including the ability to cancel directly in a user-friendly pop-up window.

- Read menus and wine lists in separate pop-ups with a clear structure, inspired by fine-dining aesthetics.

- Send messages to the restaurant via a contact form with confirmation and automatic reset.

## üé® UX & Design 

#### 1. Font

The project uses Google Fonts to create a modern yet elegant feel:
- Poppins - used for body text ‚Äì a sans-serif font that is stylish and easy to read.
- Playfair Display - used for headlines ‚Äì a serif font that adds personality and a touch of luxury.

#### 2. Color Scheme

The color palette is chosen to create a warm and inviting experience that suits an exclusive restaurant environment:
- Background: Dark tones (black / dark gray) for elegance.
- Text color: White for high contrast and readability.
- Accent colors: Natural shades of beige, brown and champagne to enhance the feeling of harmony, balance and exclusivity.

The color palette was also tested in contrast controls for accessibility.


#### 3. Logo

The logo (‚Äúlogo-bite‚Äù) is centrally positioned and responsive.
- It is clearly displayed on larger screens but is automatically hidden during pop-up activities and mobile menus so as not to block features.
- The image is vector-based and adapted to maintain high quality in all resolutions.


#### 4. Geometry / Layout
- Grid structure: Flexbox is used to create dynamic sections, centering and popup positioning.
- Carousel layout: Built with vw and vh dimensions to take up the entire screen and work smoothly on all devices.
- Popup forms: All forms (booking, contact, registration, login) are placed centrally and are overlaid with a dark background for focus.


#### 5. Wireframing & Proposed / Implemented Functionality per Page
- Wireframes were developed early in the development process and iterated as the project progressed.
- Home page: Welcome text + image
- Carousel section: Navigation between menu blocks with arrows
- Popup design: Used for all forms
- Mobile layout: Adapted with media queries for optimal experience

- Fullscreen carousel

    - A full-screen image carousel that appears immediately after the home page. 
<br>The user can scroll between sections using arrows. The carousel contains both images and menus.

- Popup-forms

    - All forms (booking, registration, contact, login) open in stylish popups on top of the page.
        SCREENSHOTS
- Mobile-friendly layout

    -  Responsive design with custom popups and navigation for smaller screens.

- Overlay menus and contact forms

    -  The wine list, menu, and contact form appear over all content and make the rest of the page inaccessible until the popup is closed.

- "My side"-view for users with login

    - Shows logged in user's bookings

    - Ability to cancel directly in the view

    - Dynamic content display based on login status


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies used

#### Languages & Frameworks

- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6),** ‚Äì Used to structure, design, and create dynamic interfaces for the entire website.

- <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> - Used for backend logic, form handling, validation, and interaction with the database via Django.

- <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> - was used as the architectural framework for the project and follows the Model-Template-View (MTV) principle. It separates logic, database structure, and presentation, creating a clear and scalable structure for the application ‚Äì perfect for a restaurant booking solution with multiple features and user flows.


#### Version Control & Deployment

- <a href="https://github.com/bjoernholmlund/project4restaurant">Github</a> - was used for version control and as a remote repository for the project's code base. It also served as a connection point to Heroku, where the latest version of the application could be automatically deployed after each push to the master branch. This enabled continuous delivery and a smooth development process.

- <a href="https://github.com/projects">GitHub Projects</a> - The project's development was structured according to an agile working method with user stories, tasks and columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) for clear traceability.

- <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> - is a cloud-based Platform as a Service (PaaS) that enables easy and seamless deployment of this full-stack Django application. It handles everything from server environment to database connections and allows automatic updates directly from GitHub, making development and deployment to production fast and secure.

####  Database & Static File Management

- <a href="">PostgreSQL</a> - A free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and technical standards compliance. Designed to handle high range of workloads including Web services with many concurrent users.

- <a href="http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/">WhiteNoise</a> - Used to easily allow the Deployed project to serve it's own static files.


#### Styling & Design

- <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts ‚Äì Poppins & Playfair Display</a> - To create a balance between modernity and elegance, two complementary fonts from Google Fonts were used:

    - Poppins ‚Äì A geometric sans-serif font used for all body text and menu information. It gives a clean, airy and easy-to-read impression that works well on both small and large screens.

    - Playfair Display ‚Äì A serif font used for headlines and section titles. It gives a luxurious and classic expression that reinforces the premium feel of the restaurant.

Together, these fonts create a typographic contrast that both supports the aesthetics of the page and improves readability. The combination contributes to a strong visual brand and a harmonious user experience.

- <a href="https://www.canva.com/sv_se/skapa/social-medier-grafik/">Canva ‚Äì Logo Design</a> - Canva was used to create the project‚Äôs logo, logo-bite. The tool offers a simple and intuitive interface for graphic design, which made it possible to quickly create a professional and visually appealing logo that matches the restaurant‚Äôs brand. The logo is used in the header to create recognition and strengthen the identity of the site. The design is responsive and adapted for both desktop and mobile views.

- <a href="https://pixabay.com/">Pixabay</a> - All background images and some decorative elements on the page are taken from Pixabay, a platform for free images and videos with an open license (CC0). These images are free to use in both commercial and non-commercial projects without requiring attribution - but as a sign of respect and transparency, the source is mentioned here.

    - Pixabay was used to:

        - Create visually strong sections in the image carousel.

        - Strengthen thematic parts of the menu (for example, dessert and drink images).

        - Contribute to the overall experience of a professional and atmospheric restaurant website.

The images have been carefully selected to match the restaurant's aesthetic, adjusted in size and in some cases edited with vignetting and color filters to create a unified design.

- <a href="https://freebiesupply.com/blog/css-arrows/">Arrows</a> - The left and right arrow icons in the image carousel are inspired by this resource. They were adapted and integrated with custom SVG styling to blend into the design and provide a smooth navigation experience between slides. The arrows are responsive, accessible, and work on both desktop and mobile devices.


#### Forms & Interactivity

- <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-widget-tweaks/">Django widget tweaks</a> ‚Äì This Django extension makes it possible to customize forms directly in templates using filters such as add_class, add_placeholder, etc. It enables stylistically uniform form fields without having to create custom forms from scratch.

- <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/api_fetch.asp">JavaScript Fetch API + FormData</a> ‚Äì Used in all your popup forms (reservation, login, register, contact) for AJAX requests to the Django backend without reloading the page.

- JavaScript scrollIntoView() + smooth scroll - Used in the hamburger menu to smoothly scroll to the correct section of the page and create a seamless navigation.


#### Testing & Validation

-  <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML Validator</a>, <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3C CSS Validator</a> & <a href="https://jshint.com/">JSHint</a> - Used to validate and improve the quality of my code, both in terms of syntax and structure. Running HTML, CSS, and JavaScript validation ensured that the code followed standards and was free of common errors that could impact functionality or compatibility.

- <a href="https://www.codewof.co.nz/style/python3/">PEP 8 Online Validator</a> - to check my python code to be consistent with PEP8 requirements.
